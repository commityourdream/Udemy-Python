SM-N960FZBDINS,Got some technical issues with mine,shiv6044,4,2018-11-29T10:24:07.000+00:00,"I bought this pjone a month ago, I was so very excited to use the phone, unfortunately it was not working properly, At the servivr centre they told me that it had some issues with manufacturing and was a natural defect in the product. But thanks to Samsung they replaced whole of the phone's components from within. And now its working awsome..."
SM-N960FZBDINS,The greatest note ever like all rounder,None,5,2018-11-28T17:20:47.000+00:00,"The good The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is a big, beautiful phone with top-tier specs including a massive battery and internal storage
But the Note 9 is no more toy. It's also powerful with a 6.4-inch screen, 4,000-mAh battery, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and either 128GB or a whopping 512GB of onboard storage, plus a microSD card if you want more, more, more. 
The Galaxy Note 9's specs are top-notch. This is an everything phone, one of the absolute best you can buy with All The Things."
SM-N960FZBDINS,"""Great"" is an understatement. It's perfection!",Zayan,5,2018-11-27T05:27:54.000+00:00,"Well, it's been almost a week since I bought the Galaxy Note 9 at a Samsung retail store. I must say I'm impressed by all means. I honestly love it. Keep up the good work, Samsung! if you need a smartphone with most of the best features this is your go to.

Best features about the Galaxy Note 9

- Sound Quality 
- Cameras
- Battery Life
- Gaming Performance 
- Processor Speed
- S-Pen
- Display Resolution 
- Water Carbon Cooling System

Etc.

However, I have some suggestions which I hope would be considered, they're just pointers, not flaws. (Maybe the 1st and 4th suggestions can be improved through system updates)

1. Games run smooth, but it could be better to optimise framerates for slightly better performance at full HD settings, I'd rate it a 98% out of 100. There's barely any difference I'd still recommend this phone for gaming.

2. I love the design, however it could be slightly more attractive on the back. Nevertheless, I still love it.

3. Keep the pricing of the phone the same or maybe a bit cheaper. It's got beautiful features and I expected nothing less, just giving my 2 cents for the future (Samsung : Galaxy Note 10) it's something I'd look forward to.

4. Optimise battery life, I know there are ways to save the battery from being drained out. Yet again, it would be great to save more battery despite playing games, using the camera, watching youtube/listening to music in general. It's not a major battery drain, it's pretty minor, it's still something something to be considered.

Conclusion : 

This is probably one of the best smartphones out there, it's an all-in-one package! I'm satisfied and I recommend this phone, it's amazing. 

Thank you, Samsung!
